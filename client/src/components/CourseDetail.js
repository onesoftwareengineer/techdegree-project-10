// CourseDetail - The component 
//     retrieves the detail for a course from the REST API, 
//     renders the course details, 
//     an "Update Course" button for navigating to the "Update Course" screen, 
//     and a "Delete Course" button that when clicked sends a DELETE request to the REST API to delete a course.
