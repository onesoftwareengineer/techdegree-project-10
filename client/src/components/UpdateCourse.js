// UpdateCourse - The component 
//     renders a form allowing a user to update one of their existing courses, 
//     an "Update Course" button that when clicked sends a PUT request to the REST API's /api/courses/:id route, 
//     and a "Cancel" button that returns the user to the "Course Detail" screen.
