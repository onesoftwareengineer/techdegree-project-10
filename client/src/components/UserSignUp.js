// UserSignUp - The component 
//     renders a form allowing a user to sign up by creating a new account, 
//     a "Sign Up" button that when clicked sends a POST request to the REST API's /api/users route and signs in the user, 
//     and a "Cancel" button that returns the user to the default route (i.e. the list of courses).
